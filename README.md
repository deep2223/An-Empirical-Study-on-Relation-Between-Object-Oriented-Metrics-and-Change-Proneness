Software Measurement Project : An Empirical Study on Relation  Between  Object-Oriented Metrics and Change-Proneness

Abstractâ€” 
            In software development, evolution of software is the most important part of it. Evolution of software means developing new versions with changes that leads to corrective and adaptive maintenance. Change proneness is an external quality attribute. It depicts the changes in classes across different version of the system. If changes are predicted earlier than errors and bugs can be prevented. In this paper, we describe the comparison of different software systems such as Eclipse, Intellij and NetBeans and co-relate the change proneness in the software during their evolution using the C&K metrics, QMOOD metrics. Additionally, we also analyzed the attributes like understandability, functionality, reusability, extendibility that are affected due to change proneness. For concluding how change-prone, a class is we computed maintainability index and using linear regression, we calculated the prediction power.
